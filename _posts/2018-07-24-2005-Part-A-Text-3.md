Of all the components[^1] of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended[^2] and dead people speak. A century ago, [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) formulated[^3] his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised[^4] shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists[^5] had switched[^6] to thinking of them as just ‘mental noise’—the random by-products[^7] of the neural[^8]-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat[^9], regulating moods while the brain is ‘off-line’. And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed[^10] but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better. ‘It’s your dream,’ says Rosalind Cartwright, chair[^11] of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. ‘If you don’t like it, change it.’

[^12]: **psychology** /sʌɪˈkɒlədʒi/ n. <br> [*mass noun*] the scientific study of the human mind and its functions, esp. those affecting behaviour in a given context <br>

Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during [REM (rapid eye movement) sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep)—when most vivid dreams occur—as it is when fully awake, says Dr. Eric Nofzinger of the sleep laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic[^13] system (the ‘emotional brain’) is especially active, while the prefrontal[^14] cortex[^15] (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. ‘We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day,’ says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement

[^13]: **limbic system** /ˈlɪmbɪk/ n. <br> a complex system of nerves and networks in the brain, involving several areas near the edge of the cortex concerned with instinct and mood. It controls the basic emotions (fear, pleasure, anger) and drives (hunger, sex, dominance, care of offspring)
[^14]: **prefrontal** /priːˈfrʌnt(ə)l/ adj. <br> in or relating to the foremost part of the frontal lobe of the brain: <br>  - *When people, especially children, experience fear from external sources, the prefrontal cortex (thinking brain) has to provide a sense of safety.* <br>

The link between dreams and emotions shows[^16] up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing[^17] toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working[^18] through negative feelings generated during the day.  Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional significance of the day’s events—until, it appears, we begin to dream.

[^16]: **show up** <br> be **conspicuous** or clearly visible: <br>  - *The orange tip shows up well against most backgrounds.* <br> **PS** **show sb/sth up** <br> 1. expose sb or sth as being bad or faulty: <br>  - *It's a pity they haven't showed up the authorities for what they are.* <br> 2. [*informal*] embarrass or humiliate sb: <br>  - *She says I showed her up in front of her friends.* <br>
[^17]: **progress** /prəˈɡrɛs/ v. [*no object*] <br> 1. develop towards an improved or more advanced condition: <br>  - *Then I had dreams of a nation progressing towards prosperity and **empowerment**.* <br> `> empowerment < /ɛmˈpaʊəm(ə)nt/ n. [mass noun] the process of becoming stronger and more confident, esp. in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights` <br> 2. [*with object*] cause (a task or undertaking) to make progress: <br>  - *Please phone me at your earliest convenience so we can progress these matters.* <br> 3. move forward or onward in space or time: <br>  - *As the century progressed the quality of telescopes improved.* <br>
[^18]: **work through** <br> go through a process of understanding and accepting (a painful or difficult situation); deal with (sth that is difficult or unpleasant) successfully: <br>  - *He saw a psychologist to help him work through his depression.* <br>  - *After someone dies, it can take a long time to work through your grief.* <br>

And this process need not be left[^19] to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise[^20] conscious control over recurring[^21] bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualise[^22] how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course[^23]. With much practice people can learn to, literally[^24], do it in their sleep.

[^19]: **leave sth to** <br> entrust a decision, choice, or action to (sb else, esp. sb considered better qualified): <br>  - *She leaves it to the reader to draw their own conclusions.* <br>  - *The choice of specialist subject is left entirely to the students.* <br>
[^20]: **exercise** /ˈɛksəsʌɪz/ v. [*with object*] <br> use or apply (a faculty, right, or process): <br>  - *Anyone receiving a suspect package should exercise extreme caution.* <br>  - *States must take effective measures to ensure that all persons entitled to vote are able to exercise that right.* <br> `> entitle < /ɪnˈtʌɪt(ə)l/ v. [with object] (often be entitled to) give sb a legal right or a just claim to receive or do sth` <br> **PS** **exercise** /ˈɛksəsʌɪz/ v. [*with object*] <br> occupy the thoughts of; worry or **perplex**: <br>  - *If only people would get so exercised about the effect of all this waste on the environment.* <br> `> if only < used to express a wish, esp. regretfully; an expression used to introduce a wish, esp. one felt to be unrealisable` <br>
[^21]: **recurring** /rɪˈkəːrɪŋ/ adj. <br> 1. ccurring again periodically or repeatedly: <br>  - *The father-daughter relationship is a recurring theme in her novels.* <br> 2. (of a thought, image, or memory) repeatedly coming back to a person's mind <br>  - *Francis suffered all his life from a recurring nightmare that he was trapped in a falling house.* <br>
[^22]: **visualise** /ˈvɪʒ(j)ʊəlʌɪz/ v. [*with object*] <br> form a mental image of; imagine: <br>  - *She tried to visualize the scene he was describing.* <br>  - *Somehow I can’t visualize myself staying with this company for much longer.* <br>
[^23]: **course** /kɔːs/ n. <br> 1. the way in which sth progresses or develops: <br>  - *Gorbachev changed the course of Soviet history.* <br>  - *The human race is on a course of discovering a new and unknown power hidden within.* <br> 2. a procedure adopted to deal with a situation: <br>  - *My decision had seemed to be the wisest course open to me at the time.* <br>  - *The central issue in the case is whether that was a justified **course of action**.* <br>
[^24]: **literally** /ˈlɪt(ə)rəli/ adv. <br> 1. in a literal manner or sense; exactly: <br>  - *Translations that are done too literally often don't flow well or don't sound natural.* <br>  - *I told him I never wanted to see him again, but I didn't expect him to **take it literally**.* <br> 2. used to emphasise the truth and accuracy of a statement or description: <br>  - *The Olympic Games were watched by literally billions of people.* <br> **PS** **literally** /ˈlɪt(ə)rəli/ adv. <br> [*informal*] used for emphasis while not being literally true: <br>  - *I literally had a heart attack when I heard the news.* <br>

At the end of the day, there’s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or ‘we wake up in a panic,’ Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people’s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent[^25] nightmares[^26] should seek help from a therapist[^27]. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep—or rather dream—on it and you’ll feel better in the morning.

[^25]: **persistent** /pəˈsɪst(ə)nt/ adj. <br> 1. continuing to exist or occur over a prolonged period: <br>  - *Constant and persistent rain is **taking its toll** on the city's infrastructure.* <br> `> take its toll < have an adverse effect` <br>  - *Management of **recurrent** or persistent pain can be extremely difficult.* <br> `> recurrent /rɪˈkʌr(ə)nt/ adj. occurring often or repeatedly` <br> 2. continuing firmly or obstinately in an opinion or course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition: <br>  - *Be patient and persistent in achieving your purpose.* <br>  - *He has been a persistent critic of US foreign policy and the IMF.* <br>  - *A judge has told a persistent drink-driver to pass a medical examination before he can drive again.* <br>
[^26]: **nightmare** /ˈnʌɪtmɛː/ n. <br> 1. a frightening or unpleasant dream: <br>  - *As a child I used to dream horrific nightmares about nuclear war.* <br> 2. a very unpleasant or frightening experience or prospect: <br>  - *The twentieth century was scarred by the nightmare of Hitler's dream for the Aryan race.* <br> 3.  a person or situation that is very difficult to deal with: <br>  - *Brad was my ex-boyfriend and the worst nightmare I have ever had to deal with.* <br>
[^27]: **therapist** /ˈθɛrəpɪst/ n. <br> 1. a person skilled in a particular kind of **therapy**: <br>  - *He is well-spoken, as people used to say, and married to a speech therapist called Susie.* <br> 2. a person who treats psychological problems; a psychotherapist: <br>  - *I think speaking with a trusted friend (or therapist) about your grief could also help.* <br>  **PS** **therapy** /ˈθɛrəpi/ n. [mass noun] <br> 1. treatment intended to relieve or heal a disorder: <br>  - *Biological therapies help the body's immune system to attack cancer cells.* <br> 2. the treatment of mental or psychological disorders by psychological means; **psychotherapy**: <br>  - *Low sexual desire is rapidly becoming the most common issue treated in psychosexual therapy.* <br>
