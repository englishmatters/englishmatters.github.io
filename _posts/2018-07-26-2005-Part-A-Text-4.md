Americans no longer expect public figures[^3], whether in **oratory**[^4] `/speech` or in writing, to command[^5] the English language with skill and **flair**[^6] `/gift`. Nor do they aspire[^7] to such command[^5] themselves. In his latest book, *Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation[^8] of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like[^9], Care*, John McWhorter, a linguist[^10] and controversialist[^11] of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph[^12] of 1960s counterculture[^13] as responsible for the decline[^14] of formal English.

Blaming the permissive[^15] 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another **screed**[^16] `/criticism` against the decline in education. Mr McWhorter's academic speciality[^17] is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom”, for example, to be natural and no more **lamentable**[^18] `/regrettable`[^19] than[^20] the loss of the [case-endings](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/case_ending) of [Beowulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf)-era English.

[^15]: **permissive** /pəˈmɪsɪv/ adj. <br> allowing or characterized by great or excessive freedom of behaviour; allowing or showing a freedom of behaviour that many people do not approve of, especially in sexual matters: <br>  - *Children of permissive parents tended to be relatively immature.* <br> `> immature < /ˌɪməˈtjʊə/ adj. lacking the emotional maturity, sense of responsibility, etc. characteristic of an adult` <br>  - *He claims that society has been far too permissive towards drugs.* <br>  - *There's a difference between a tolerant society and a permissive society.* <br>

But the cult[^21] of the authentic[^22] and the personal, “doing our own thing”, has spelt[^23] the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly[^24] educated sought an elevated[^25] tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded[^26] writing since then has sought to capture[^27] spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative[^28] genre[^29] is the only form that could claim real **vibrancy**[^30] `/liveliness`[^31]. In both oral[^32] and written English, talking is triumphing[^12] over speaking, spontaneity[^33] over craft[^34].

Illustrated[^35] with an entertaining[^36] array[^37] of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle[^38], why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like [Black English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_English), can be powerfully expressive—there exists no language or dialect[^39] in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight[^40] because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks[^41] of memorised poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate[^42] oratory[^4] that would seem old-fashioned[^43] to most English-speakers. Mr McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical[^44] education reforms—he is really **bemoaning**[^45] `/grieving over`[^46] the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china”. A shame[^47], perhaps, but probably an inevitable[^48] one.
