Canada's premiers[^1], if they have any breath left after **whining**[^2] `/complaining` about Ottawa[^3] at their late July annual meeting, might spare[^4] a moment to do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.

According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription[^8] drug costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall[^9] health-care spending. Part of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.

[^8]: **prescription** /prəˈskrɪpʃ(ə)n/ n. <br> 1. an instruction written by a medical practitioner that authorizes a patient to be provided a medicine or treatment: <br>  - *These drugs are only available on prescription (= with a prescription from a doctor).* <br> 2. a recommendation that is authoritatively put forward: <br>  - *Both parties will be **outlining** their prescription for economic recovery.* <br> `> outline < /ˈaʊtˌlaɪn/ v.

What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care—to say nothing of reports from other experts—recommended[^10] the creation of a national drug agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy[^11], procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool[^12] resources, work with Ottawa, and create a national institution.

[^10]: **recommend** /ˌrɛkəˈmɛnd/ v. [*with object*] <br> 1. put forward sb/sth with approval as being suitable for a particular purpose or role: <br>  - *They recommended her for a promotion after only two years.* <br>  - *The book is recommended to anyone for its portrayal of a unique and courageous intellectual life.* <br>  - *The hotel's new restaurant comes highly recommended (= a lot of people have praised it).* <br> 2. advise or suggest (sth) as a course of action; advise sb to do sth: <br>  - *You are strongly recommended to seek professional advice.* <br>  - *It is strongly recommended that the machines should be checked every year.* <br>  - *I strongly recommend reading it yourself to make your own judgement about what it says.* <br>  - *For your safety, we recommend you keep your seat belt loosely fastened during the flight.* <br> **PS** **commend** /kəˈmɛnd/ v.

[^11]: **bureaucracy** /ˌbjʊ(ə)ˈrɒkrəsi/ n. <br> 1. a system of government in which most of the important decisions are taken by state officials rather than by elected representatives: <br>  - *Weber's most notable contribution, however, **lay** in identifying the importance of bureaucracy to modern politics.* <br> `> lie < /lʌɪ/ v. [no object] (of sth abstract) reside or be found` <br> 2. excessively complicated administrative procedure: <br>  - *She was **fed up** with all the **red tape** and bureaucracy.* <br> `> fed up < adj.

[^12]: **pool** /puːl/ v. [*with object*] <br> 1. share (resources or information) for the benefit of all involved: <br>  - *They entered a contract to pool any gains and invest them profitably.* <br>  - *The kids pooled their money to buy their parents a wedding anniversary gift.* <br>  - *The students work individually, then pool their ideas in groups of six.* <br>  - *Police forces across the country are pooling resources in order to solve this crime.* <br> **PS** **pool** /puːl/ n. <br> a number of things that are shared or an amount of money that is shared by a group of people: <br>  - *Both partners put money into a common pool.* <br>

What does ‘national’ mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.

But ‘national’ doesn't have to mean that. ‘National’ could mean interprovincial—provinces combining efforts to create one body.

Either way[^13], one benefit of a ‘national’ organisation would be to negotiate better prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers[^14]. Instead of having one province—or a series of hospitals within a province—negotiate a price for a given drug on the provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf[^15] of all provinces.

[^13]: **either way** <br> whichever of two given alternatives is the case: <br>  - *It was either give in now or give in later, either way I was going to give in.* <br> `> give in < cease fighting or arguing; admit defeat` <br>  - *She might be guilty or she might be innocent but either way at least someone has been held to account.* <br>
[^14]: **manufacturer** /ˌmanjʊˈfaktʃ(ə)rə/ n. <br> a person or company that makes goods for sale: <br>  - *No computer game manufacturer has produced a game of such universal appeal.* <br> **PS** **manufacture** /manjʊˈfaktʃə/ v. [*with object*] <br> 1. make sth on a large scale using machinery: <br>  - *He works for a company that manufactures car parts.* <br>  - *The report notes a rapid decline in manufactured goods.* <br> 2.  (of a living thing) produce (a substance) naturally: <br>  - *Most plants use the sun's light to manufacture their food through photosynthesis.* <br> 3. make or produce (sth abstract) in a merely mechanical way: <br>  - *Julia manufactured a smile.* <br> 4. invent (evidence or a story): <br>  - *All the details of the story turned out to be false and manufactured by the reporter himself.* <br>  - *Under stress, whether real or manufactured, the institutions we take for granted are subject to change.* <br>
[^15]: **behalf** /bɪˈhɑːf/ n.  **on behalf of sb** or **on sb’s behalf** <br> 1. as a representative of: <br>  - *On behalf of my colleagues it gives me pleasure to welcome Mark on to the Board of Directors.* <br>  - *Unfortunately, George cannot be with us today so I am pleased to accept this award on his behalf.* <br> 2. (*US* **in behalf of sb** or **in sb’s behalf**) <br> in the interests of a person, group, or principle: <br>  - *She spoke in behalf of the other candidate.* <br>  - *They're willing to do anything on their child's behalf.* <br> 3. because of sb; for sb: <br>  - *Don't worry on my behalf.* <br> **TIP** A body of opinion favours **in** with the ‘interest, benefit’ sense of behalf and **on** with the ‘support, defence’ sense. This distinction has been observed by some writers but overall has never had a sound basis in actual usage. In current British use, **on behalf (of)** has replaced **in behalf (of)**; both are still used in American English, but the distinction is frequently not observed.

Rather than, say[^16], Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood[^17] of a better price.

[^16]: **say** /seɪ/ v. <br> used parenthetically to indicate that something is being suggested as possible or likely but not certain: <br>  - *You could learn the basics in, let's say, three months.* <br>  - *The property is worth, say, four million dollars. = The property is worth four million dollars, say. [=the property is worth about four million dollars]* <br> **PS** **say** /seɪ/ v. <br> [*with clause*] assume sth in order to work out what its consequences would be; make a hypothesis: <br>  - *Say you lose your job: what would you do then?* <br>  - *Say/Let's say (= if we accept) (**that**) the journey takes three hours, then you'd be there by two o'clock.* <br>
[^17]: **likelihood** /ˈlʌɪklɪhʊd/ n. <br> the state or fact of something's being likely; **probability**: <br>  - *young people who can see no likelihood of finding employment* <br>  - *Using a seatbelt will reduce the likelihood of serious injury in a car accident.* <br>  - *There is every likelihood that he will be reelected. [=he will almost certainly be reelected]* <br>  - _**In all likelihood** it will rain tomorrow. [=it is very likely that it will rain tomorrow]_ <br>

Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream[^18]. They like divided buyers; they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure will cause others to include it on theirs. Getting a drug on the provincial formulary[^19] is important for the companies, given that listing obviously drives[^20] up the number of consumers. They wouldn't like a national agency, but self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

[^18]: **scream** /skriːm/ v. [*no object*] <br> 1. give a long, loud, piercing cry or cries expressing extreme emotion or pain: <br>  - *She screamed in horror as she fell, thinking she was soon to die.* <br>  - *Rachel screamed out in pain as tears began rolling down her cheeks.* <br> 2. cry something in a high-pitched, frenzied way: <br>  - *‘Get out!’ he screamed.* <br>  - *I ran to the house screaming for help.* <br> 3.  urgently and vociferously call attention to one's views or feelings, esp. ones of anger or distress: <br>  - *His supporters scream that he is being done an injustice.* <br>  - *At some point, though, our inner lives may scream for our attention, and this can come as a complete surprise.* <br> **PS** [_**The Scream**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream) (1893) by *Edvard Munch* <br>

[^19]: **formulary** /ˈfɔːmjʊləri/ n. <br> an official list giving details of prescribable medicines: <br>  - *The national formulary of medicines lists the essential drugs that can be acquired by, and distributed through, Mozambique's national health system.* <br> **PS** **formula** /ˈfɔːmjʊlə/ n. <br> 1. a list of ingredients with which something is made: <br>  - *He refused to disclose any further details on his secret formula.* <br> 2. a method or procedure for achieving sth: <br>  - *There is no **magic formula** (=a method that is certain to be successful) that will transform sorrow into happiness.* <br>  - *The combination of convenience stores and online shops has proven to be a winning formula for the company.* <br>  - *Different ideologies, the Left, the Right and the Centre, have failed to provide a **panacea** for war and a formula for peace.* <br> `> panacea < /ˌpanəˈsiːə/ n. a solution or remedy for all difficulties or diseases` <br>
[^20]: **drive sth up** <br> force prices, costs etc to rise quickly: <br>  - *The government’s policies are driving up interest rates.* <br>  - *The oil shortage drove gas prices up by 20 cents a gallon.* <br>

A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the Canadian Co-ordinating[^21] Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the provinces.

[^21]: **co-ordinating** /kəʊˈɔːdɪneɪtɪŋ/ adj. <br> 1. matching or harmonizing attractively: <br>  - *a variety of coordinating colours* <br> 2. bringing the different elements of something complex into a harmonious and efficient relationship: <br>  - *The coordinating committee has decided how to divide up the £7.5 million payment.* <br> **PS** **co-ordinate** /kəʊˈɔːdɪneɪt/ v. [*with object*] <br> 1. bring the different elements of (a complex activity or organisation) into a harmonious or efficient relationship: <br>  - *In order to coordinate these efforts, an international research group was created.* <br> 2. [*no object*] negotiate with others in order to work together effectively: <br>  - *We then coordinated with other agencies to ensure the command was aware of these activities.* <br> 3. [*no object*] match or harmonize attractively: <br>  - *Belts need to match or closely coordinate with your shoes.* <br>

Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial formularies which new drugs should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join. (Quebec's resistance[^22] is provincialist[^23] ideology[^24]. One of the first advocates[^25] for a national formulary was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec's Drug Insurance Fund, created in 1997 to insure citizens without drug coverage[^26], has seen its costs skyrocket[^27] with annual increases—wait for it—from 14.3 per cent to 26.8 per cent!)

[^22]: **resistance** /rɪˈzɪst(ə)ns/ n. <br> 1. [*mass noun*] the refusal to accept or comply with sth: <br>  - *They displayed a **narrow-minded** resistance to change.* <br> `> narrow-minded < /narəʊˈmʌɪndɪd/ adj. not willing to listen to or tolerate other people's views; prejudiced` <br>  - *Many people seem to take this for granted and consider all resistance **futile**.* <br> `> futile < /ˈfjuːtʌɪl/ adj. incapable of producing any useful result; pointless` <br> 2. the use of force or violence to oppose sb/sth: <br>  - *There was little armed resistance in either of those countries after the **armistices** had been signed.* <br> `> armistice < /ˈɑːmɪstɪs/ n. an agreement made by opposing sides in a war to stop fighting for a certain time; a truce` <br> 3. the ability not to be affected by sth, esp. adversely: <br>  - *Some of us have a lower resistance to cold than others.* <br>  - *The drugs used to prevent the body rejecting the new heart **adversely** weakened his resistance to infection.* <br> `> adversely < /ˈadvəːsli/ adv. in a way that prevents success or development; harmfully or unfavourably` <br>
[^23]: **provincialism** /prəˈvɪnʃ(ə)lɪz(ə)m/ n. [*mass noun*] <br> 1. concern for one's own area or region at the expense of national or supranational unity: <br>  - *The President warned that focusing on relations with close neighbours would lead to political provincialism.* <br> 2. the way of life characteristic of the regions outside the capital city of a country, esp. when regarded as unsophisticated or narrow-minded: <br>  - *It is entirely possible that conservative policies will lead to more cultural regionalism and provincialism.* <br>  - *That type of narrow provincialism is exactly what I associate with those who advocate preserving the ‘**sanctity**’ of marriage.* <br> `> sanctity < /ˈsaŋ(k)tɪti/ n. [mass noun] the state or quality of being holy, sacred, or saintly` <br>
[^24]: **ideology** /ˌʌɪdɪˈɒlədʒi/ n. <br> 1. a system of ideas and ideals, esp. one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy: <br>  - *Traditionally, the name of a party represents its political ideology and values.* <br>  - *The term Libertarian stands for a political ideology that basis itself on freedom.* <br> 2. the set of beliefs characteristic of a social group or individual: <br>  - *In a modern state, it is a basic role of the government to protect its citizens **irrespective of** their ideology and beliefs.* <br> `> irrespective < /ɪrɪˈspɛktɪv/ adj. (irrespective of) ot taking sth into account; regardless of` <br> **PS** **ideological** /ˌʌɪdɪəˈlɒdʒɪk(ə)l/ adj. <br>  - *the ideological struggle that **underpinned** the cold war* <br> `> underpin < /ʌndəˈpɪn/ v. [with object] support, justify, or form the basis for` <br>  - *Surely here is a clear case where your own ideological bias has led you to report something which is wrong.* <br>
[^25]: **advocate** /ˈadvəkət/ n. <br> a person who publicly supports or recommends a particular cause or policy: <br>  - *She works as a consumer advocate.* <br>  - *He was an **untiring** advocate of economic reform.* <br> `> untiring < /ʌnˈtʌɪərɪŋ/ adj.

A few premiers are suspicious[^28] of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork[^29] over additional billions with few, if any, strings[^30] attached. That's one reason why the idea of a national formulary hasn't gone anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.

[^28]: **suspicious** /səˈspɪʃəs/ adj. <br> 1. having or showing a cautious distrust of sb/sth: <br>  - *She gave him a suspicious glance.* <br>  - *No doubt, even those who are not firmly anti-American will be deeply suspicious of American motives.* <br> 2. causing one to have the idea or impression that sb/sth is questionable, dishonest, or dangerous: <br>  - *Police are not treating the death as suspicious, but inquiries are **on-going**.* <br> `> ongoing < /ˈɒnɡəʊɪŋ/ adj. continuing; still in progress` <br>  - *We are also urged to be **vigilant** for suspicious behaviour, vehicles and packages.* <br> `> vigilant < /ˈvɪdʒɪl(ə)nt/ adj.

[^29]: **fork sth out/over/up** <br> pay money for sth, especially reluctantly: <br>  - *He had high hopes for his birthday **bash** and even forked out £10,000 for a private party.* <br> `> bash < /baʃ/ n. a party or social event` <br>  - *Congress will simply continue to fork over **subsidies** to special interests.* <br> `> subsidy < /ˈsʌbsɪdi/ n. a sum of money granted by the state or a public body to help an industry or business keep the price of a commodity or service low` <br>
[^30]: **string** /strɪŋ/ n. <br> (**strings**) requirements that are connected with sth; special conditions or restrictions: <br>  - *Most of these so-called special offers come with strings attached.* <br>  - *I am willing to offer you a position, **no strings attached**.* <br> `> no strings attached < [informal] used to show that an offer or opportunity carries no special conditions or restrictions` <br>  - *He's generous, but there are always strings attached. [=he always expects something in return for what he gives to people]* <br>

So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show[^31], they should prove they can run it, starting with an interprovincial health formulary that would end duplication[^32], save administrative costs, prevent one province from being played[^33] off against another, and bargain for better drug prices.

[^31]: **show** /ʃəʊ/ n. <br> [*informal*] an undertaking, project, or organisation: <br>  - *They made it clear who is now **running the show**.* <br> `> run the show < take charge of or manage an affair, business, etc` <br>
[^32]: **duplicate** /ˈdjuːplɪkeɪt/ v. [*with object*] <br> 1. make or be an exact copy of: <br>  - *Information sheets had to be typed and duplicated.* <br>  - *More likely, they thought they could duplicate the Spain success.* <br> 2. do (sth) again unnecessarily: <br>  - *Most of these proposals duplicated work already done.* <br> **PS** **duplication** /djuːplɪˈkeɪʃn/ n. [*mass noun*] <br> the action or process of duplicating sth: <br>  - *an attempt to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort* <br>  - *The process of duplication ensures that at least one copy of your information is available **in the event** the primary copy is disrupted.* <br> `> in the event that < if; should it happen that` <br>
[^33]: **play sb off** <br> bring people into conflict or competition for one's own advantage: <br>  - *Top footballers were able to play clubs off **against** each other to gain higher pay.* <br>  - *Airlines usually negotiate privately with manufacturers, playing one off against another, of course.* <br>

Premiers love to quote[^34] Mr. Romanow’s report selectively, especially the parts about more federal money.
