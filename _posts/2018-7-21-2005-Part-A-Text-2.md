Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure?

There are **eerie**[^9] `/upsetting`[^10] parallels[^11] today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken[^12] us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel[^13] from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted[^14] by the Bush administration, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man‑made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in a **preamble**[^15] `/preface`[^16] to the panel's report: 'Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning[^17] the future consequences of present actions.'

Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters[^18] insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes[^19] into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: By the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it maybe too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent[^20] people[^21] would take[^22] out an insurance policy[^23] now.

[^18]: **quarter** /ˈk(w)ɔːtə/ n. <br> a particular but unspecified person, group of people, or area: <br>  - *The U.N.

Fortunately, the Bush administration is starting to pay attention. But it's obvious that a majority of the president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research–a classic case of '<u>paralysis[^24] by analysis[^25]</u>.'

To serve as responsible stewards[^26] of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate[^27]. If the administration won't take the legislative[^28] initiative[^29], Congress should **step into the breach**[^30] `/help` to begin fashioning[^31] conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, which would offer financial incentives[^32] for private industry, is a promising[^33] start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever[^34] going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound[^35].

(of a person) unable to deal with a situation or with life: <br>  - *Valentine's day may be a **conspiracy** to make single people feel inadequate.* <br> `> conspiracy < /kənˈspɪrəsi/ n. a secret plan by a group to do sth unlawful or harmful` <br>  - *At the same time, he felt inadequate to the task of **measuring up** to either parent's expectations.* <br>  `> measure up < [no object] reach the required or expected standard` <br>
