The human nose is an underrated[^1] tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers compared with animals, <u>1 but</u> this is largely because, <u>2 unlike</u> animals, we stand upright. This means that our nose are <u>3 limited</u> to perceiving those smells which float through the air, <u>4 missing</u> the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact, <u>5 thought</u>, we are extremely sensitive to smells, <u>6 even if</u> we do not generally realise it. Our noses are capable of <u>7 detecting</u> human smells even when these are <u>8 diluted</u> to far below one part in one million.

Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another, <u>9 whereas</u> others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate <u>10 particular</u> smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send <u>11 messages</u> to the brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell <u>12 at first</u> can suddenly become sensitive to it when <u>13 exposed</u> to it often enough.

The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it <u>14 inefficient</u> to keep all smell receptors working all the time but can <u>15 creat</u> new receptors if necessary. This may <u>16 also</u> explains why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells—we simply do not need to be. We are not <u>17 aware</u> of the usual smell of our own house, but we <u>18 notice</u> new smells when we visit someone else's. The brain finds it best to keep smell receptors <u>19 available</u> for unfamiliar and emergency signals <u>20 such as</u> the smell of smoke, which might indicate the danger of fire.
