The human nose is an underrated[^1] tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive[^2] smellers compared with animals, <u>1 but</u> this is largely because, <u>2 unlike</u> animals, we stand upright[^3]. This means that our nose are <u>3 limited</u> to perceiving[^4] those smells which float through the air, <u>4 missing</u> the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. <!--more-->In fact, <u>5 thought</u>, we are extremely sensitive to smells, <u>6 even if</u> we do not generally realise it. Our noses are capable of <u>7 detecting</u> human smells even when these are <u>8 diluted</u> to far below one part[^5] in one million.  

[^1]: **underrate** /ʌndəˈreɪt/ v. [*with object*] (often as adj. **underrated**) <br> underestimate the extent / value / importance of sb / sth: *a very underrated film* <br> **SYN** underestimate <br> **OPP** overrate  
[^2]: **insensitive** /ɪnˈsɛnsɪtɪv/ adj. <br> not sensitive to a physical sensation: *She was remarkably insensitive to pain.* <br> **OPP** **sensitive** /ˈsɛnsɪtɪv/ adj. quick to detect / respond to slight changes / signals / influences  
[^3]: **upright** /ˈʌprʌɪt/ adj. <br> (of a person) sitting / standing with the back straight: *an upright posture* <br> **PLUS** **upright** /ˈʌprʌɪt/ adj. strictly honourable / honest: *an upright / upstanding citizen* <br> **upstanding** /ʌpˈstandɪŋ/ adj. honest; respectable  
[^4]: **perceive** /pəˈsiːv/ v. [*with object*] <br> become aware of sth by the use of one of the senses, esp. that of sight: <br>  - *As humans, our five senses are basic ways through which we perceive the world.* <br>  - *We perceive our environment via our senses of smell, touch, taste, hearing, sight.*  
[^5]: **part** /pɑːt/ n. <br> a measure allowing comparison between the amounts of different ingredients used in a mixture; one of several equal or nearly equal divisions: <br>  - *mix two parts flour to one part water.  

Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another, <u>9 whereas</u> others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate[^6] <u>10 particular</u> smell receptors[^7] in the nose. These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send <u>11 messages</u> to the brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell <u>12 at first</u> can suddenly become sensitive to it when <u>13 exposed</u> to it often enough.  

[^6]: **generate** /ˈdʒɛnəreɪt/ v. [*with object*] <br> produce / create: <br>  - *generate energy / electricity / heat / power* <br>  - *generate revenue / profits / income / enormous interest* <br>  - *generate controversy / emotions / new ideas / employment opportunities*  
[^7]: **receptor** /rɪˈsɛptə/ n. <br> an organ / cell able to respond to light, heat, or other external stimulus and transmit a signal to a sensory nerve

The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it <u>14 inefficient</u> to keep all smell receptors working all the time but can <u>15 create</u> new receptors if necessary. This may <u>16 also</u> explains why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells—we simply do not need to be. We are not <u>17 aware</u> of the usual smell of our own house, but we <u>18 notice</u> new smells when we visit someone else's. The brain finds it best to keep smell receptors <u>19 available</u> for unfamiliar and emergency signals <u>20 such as</u> the smell of smoke, which might indicate[^8] the danger of fire.  

[^8]: **indicate** /ˈɪndɪkeɪt/ v. [*with object*] <br> be a sign of; strongly suggest: <br>  -  A red sky at night often indicates fine weather the next day. <br>  - *Evidence came to light indicating that the train drivers involved took all possible actions to reduce the serious nature of the accident.*
